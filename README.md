Hi, I'm Marco Santonocito. Here are some things about me:

👨‍💻 I'm Head of Product in Talent Garden, the European leader in digital education. Here I lead the product strategy, product design, research, and growth.

🪴‍ I worked for five years as Chief Technology Officer at Vitesy, a startup that designs, builds, and produces smart air purifiers that monitor air quality in your home and office. Here I helped them design and develop a scalable infrastructure that supports thousands of devices worldwide, collecting and analyzing air-quality data.

📚 In 2017 I founded Ammesso.it, as an Indie Hacker. It’s a test prep mobile application that helps students enter Italian universities. Today it has more than 120.000 registered students. In 2021 it was acquired by Testbusters.

🏙 In 2015 I cofounded a co-working space in my city, Talent Garden Pordenone.

👨‍🏫 I’m a professor for the Master in Product Management organized by Product Heroes.

🤝 In 2022 I co-founded the Product Manager Alliance, an association born with the mission of supporting, promoting, and evolving product management practices in an international community that brings together all the people who work with digital products and services.
